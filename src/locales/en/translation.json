    "ip-tracking-1": "Each time you visit a webpage, your <1>IP address</1> is transmitted, allowing the website's server to know where to send the requested content",
    "ip-tracking-2": "Your IP address can be utilized to determine your approximate <2>geolocation</2>.",
    "ip-tracking-3": "Advertisers leverage this information to display ads that are relevant to your specific region.",
    "ip-tracking-4": "Additionally, many <strong>streaming services</strong> use IP tracking for <strong>geo-blocking</strong>. This practice restricts access to content based on the user's geographical location. For example, certain shows or movies may only be available in specific countries due to licensing agreements.",

    "tracking-pixels": "<0>Tracking Pixels</0> are tiny images â€” often just a single pixel in size â€” that are embedded within a website<2></2>. These images are typically invisible to users.",
    "tracking-pixels-1": "The primary purpose of a tracking pixel is to load an image from a remote server. When this image is requested, your browser sends a request to the server, allowing it to know that you have visited that specific webpage.",

    "device-fp": "<0>Device Fingerprinting</0> â€” also known as <3>browser fingerprinting</3> â€” is a technique that can identify you by combining various attributes from your browser and the device you are using",

    "browsers-2": "While many people use <1>Google Chrome</1><2></2>, it is actually one of the least privacy-friendly options available if you want to minimize tracking<4></4>.",
    "browsers-3": "The reason for this is that Google generates billions of dollars each year from targeted advertising, making it in their interest to track your online behavior extensively.",

    "ad-blockers-3": "URLs from these lists are blocked from loading, helping to safeguard your privacy.",
    "ad-blockers-4": "There are many different ad blocker extensions available, some of which are free while others require a subscription.",

    "more-2": "Avoiding the use of the same browser for all your activities can help mitigate tracking, as it becomes more challenging to track someone across different browsers. For instance, using one browser for social media and another for web searches can help keep your contexts separate.",
    "more-3": "Not loading images by default in email programs is also recommended to protect you against Tracking Pixels.",
    "more-4": "Regularly clearing cookies and using browser extensions to manage them, also can prevent long-term tracking",
