          <SectionTitle>IP Tracking</SectionTitle> functions as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time you visit a webpage, your <strong>IP address</strong> is transmitted, allowing
          the website's server to know where to send the requested content
          <Reference referenceName="fisherWhatPublicIP2022" references={references.current} />.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your IP address can be utilized to determine your approximate <strong>geolocation</strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Advertisers leverage this information to display ads that are relevant to your specific
          region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, many <strong>streaming services</strong> use IP tracking for{" "}
          <strong>geo-blocking</strong>. This practice restricts access to content based on the
          user's geographical location. For example, certain shows or movies may only be available
          in specific countries due to licensing agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a <strong>VPN</strong> can help protect your IP address and enhance your online
          privacy. You can learn more about this{" "}

      <PageSection bg references={getReferencesForBlock("tracking-pixel")}>
        <p>
          <SectionTitle>Tracking Pixels</SectionTitle> are tiny images â€” often just a single pixel
          in size â€” that are embedded within a website
          <Reference referenceName="teamWhatAreTracking" references={references.current} />. These
          images are typically invisible to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of a tracking pixel is to load an image from a remote server. When
          this image is requested, your browser sends a request to the server, allowing it to know
          that you have visited that specific webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking pixels are particularly effective when included in emails. By embedding these
          pixels in emails, senders can determine whether you have opened and viewed the message.
        </p>
      </PageSection>

      <PageSection references={getReferencesForBlock("cookies")}>
        <p>
          <SectionTitle>Cookies</SectionTitle> are small data files that are stored in your browser
          when you visit a website
          <Reference
            referenceName={["kristolHTTPCookiesStandards2001", "HTTPCookie2025"]}
            references={references.current}
          />
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies are commonly used to remember your preferences and login details, allowing you to
          avoid re-entering your username and password each time you revisit a site.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are different types of cookies, including{" "}
          <strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These cookies are primarily set by tracking companies and are used to monitor your
          activity across the web, collecting data about the websites you visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regularly clearing the cookies stored in your browser can help enhance your privacy and
          protect your personal information.

      <PageSection bg references={getReferencesForBlock("fp")}>
        <p>
          <SectionTitle>Device Fingerprinting</SectionTitle> â€” also known as{" "}
          <strong>browser fingerprinting</strong> â€” is a technique that can identify you by
          combining various attributes from your browser and the device you are using
          <Reference referenceName="DeviceFingerprint2025" references={references.current} />.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method works because different browsers and hardware configurations return different
          values for these attributes.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the commonly used attributes include:</p>
        <ul className="ml-4 list-disc">
          <li>Your screen size</li>
          <li>Your timezone</li>
          <li>The browser you are using</li>
          <li>Your geolocation</li>
          <li>Hardware specifications (such as HTML Canvas and Web Audio)</li>
          <li>And many more...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This tracking method is particularly effective because it is challenging to protect
          against. Unlike cookies, you cannot simply delete the data on your computer, as your
          computer itself serves as the data.
